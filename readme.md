## Treehouse PDX Meetup
### Kenneth Love
### 11-19-2014

## Prerequisites

1. Install Python 3.4+ on your computer. [You can see how to do that here](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/setting-up-a-local-python-environment)
2. Download/clone this repository.

## How to run the tests

1. `cd` into the downloaded/cloned directory.
2. `python test_filter.py` will run the tests for the `filter()` function.
3. `python -m unittest` should run all of the tests in the directory.


## How to make the tests pass

1. Write the code that the tests want. (But that's why you're coming to the meetup, huh?)
